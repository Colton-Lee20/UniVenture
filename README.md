# UniVenture

Univentures is a web app that lets college students see what there is to do in their area, as
well as see what others are up to. Plan your next adventure with Univentures! Users will be
able discover nearby “adventures” such as places to eat, explore, or socialize. These can have
ratings and reviews by users themselves. Adventures will be shown by either a user adding
a recommended place, or existing places via Google’s Places API. The user’s experience will
depend on which university they go to, as they will select their university when they go look
for an adventure. This expands the nearby adventures to include campus activities as well. We
will implement an email verification process to prove a user actually goes to the university they
select. The app should be able to function without an account, the user just won’t be able to
give feedback or create adventures. An extra feature we plan on implementing is a “Surprise
Me!” option that gives the user a random adventure to go on.
